                    Arie is a pragmatic who embeds his pragmatism in structure, discipline & common sense from his early days in the health care and the military forces up to where he is today. This eventually led to being one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto.
                </p><p>
                    Over the years Arie has become an expert on Agile transformations and Business Agility. Arie is working for Wemanity these days as thought leader and within Wemanity responsible for international transformations (across the globe) and works with an international team to get this done. 
                </p><p>
                    Next to this work in Agile and Agile transformations Arie lectured at the Rotterdam University (20 years), Amsterdam (7 years) and Utrecht (3years) on topics such as Agile, (Agile) project management, Business value and Agile transformations. Arie developed the Agile transformation framework IATM. 
                </p><p>
                    His first book is about how to handle change and objectives as an individual (#YouAreTheArchitectOfYourOwnLife) and his second book on delivering business agility (#AgilePracticesForBusinessValue) is coming out soon.
