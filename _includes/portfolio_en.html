                Arie is a pragmatic who embeds his pragmatism in structure, discipline & common sense from his early days in the health care and the military forces up to where he is today. This eventually led to being one of the authors of the Agile Manifesto.
            </p><p>
                Over the years Arie has become an expert on Agile transformations and Business Agility. Arie is working for Wemanity these days as thought leader and within Wemanity responsible for international transformations (across the globe) and works with an international team to get this done. 
            </p><p>
